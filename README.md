# Book_Recommender_Agent
A personal AI agent chatbot that recommends you books based off your reading patterns, moods, favorite genres etc.

Buit as a personal project to satisfy my current love of reading sci-fi novels whilst expanding my knowledge of agentic ai, this project uses Chroma's vector database and langChain's OpenAI integrationto to deliver accurate and tailored recommendations and details based off of users reading history. With the local Chroma database this chatbot utilizes RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to be more precise in its recommendation strategy and has actually given me a whole list of new books to read.

**Usage of this code does require a .env file with user's personal OpenAI api key***
